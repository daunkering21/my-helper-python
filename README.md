Hello, my name is Tev Immanuel ðŸ‘‹

This repository serves as my personal collection of Python scripts that help me develop various applications and fulfill my needs while building websites or mobile apps (currently, only Android ðŸ˜…).

About This Repository

Here, you will find different Python scripts that I use for automation, testing, and improving my development workflow. Some of them are simple utilities, while others serve more advanced purposes.

For example, kadal.py is a script designed to be run from Termux to send HTTP requests to a specific website with a configurable number of requests (mainly for testing rate limiters!).

Usage Disclaimer

You are free to use the scripts in this repository, but please use them responsibly. Some scripts might have the potential to perform actions that should be handled with care, especially when making HTTP requests.

Feedback & Contributions

I welcome any feedback! Feel free to suggest improvements, report issues, or fork the project if you find something useful. Also, please understand that some scripts may not be written perfectly since I often rely on AI technology, especially ChatGPT, for assistance. ðŸ˜†

Thank you for checking out my repository! ðŸš€
